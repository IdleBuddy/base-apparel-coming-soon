## My process

### Built with

- Visual Studio Code
- Desktop Workflow First

### What I learned

Up to this point I have just been working on small containers for projects, this is the first time I had to make something that takes up the entire window. I also learned how to validate an email using JavaScript, but it also looks like HTML5 does in house validation for input windows.

### Continued development

Make the responsiveness more fluid and feel better to look at. Im not entirely happy with how the CSS turn out and want to look into it more.
